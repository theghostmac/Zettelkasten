# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a powerful storage site designed for developers to create accounts, log in, and organize their thoughts, 
slips, and ideas in the form of notes called "zettels." This application is built with Golang, a fast and 
efficient programming language, to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can easily create new accounts by providing their desired username and password.
- **Login**: Registered users can securely log in to their accounts using their credentials.
- **Zettel Creation**: Once logged in, users can write and save zettels containing their thoughts, slips, or ideas. Each zettel can be given a title and a body.
- **Organization and Tagging**: Zettels can be organized using tags, allowing users to categorize and group related notes together for easier navigation and retrieval.
- **Search**: The app provides a powerful search functionality, enabling users to find specific zettels based on titles, tags, or content.
- **Editing and Deleting**: Users have the flexibility to edit or delete their zettels whenever necessary, ensuring they can refine their ideas over time.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a dedicated profile page, displaying their username and a collection of their zettels.
- **Collaboration**: Users can choose to share their zettels with others, enabling collaboration and idea sharing within the developer community.
